# Louisville Metro Government Salaries Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze salary data provided by the Louisville Metro Government. We are particularly interested in investigating overtime spending that exceeds 60 hours for government employees. This analysis can provide insights into resource allocation, workforce management, and potentially uncover areas for optimization in government spending. Secondly, in the LMPD shooting notebook, we conducted an exploratory analysis to investigate whether any correlations between overtime and shootings could be identified. In our analysis, we did not observe any significant correlation between hours worked and the occurrence of shootings, nor did we find that years of experience played a decisive role in these incidents.

## Data Source

We obtained the salary data from the Louisville Metro Government's open data portal. The dataset includes information about employees, their job titles, salaries, and overtime hours worked.

## Project Goals

1. **Data Exploration:** We will begin by exploring the dataset, understanding its structure, and identifying any missing or inconsistent data.

2. **Filtering Overtime:** We will filter the data to focus on overtime hours worked by government employees, specifically those exceeding 60 hours.

3. **Analysis:** We will conduct various analyses to gain insights into the distribution of overtime hours, departments with the highest overtime, and trends over time.

4. **Visualization:** We will create visualizations, such as charts and graphs, to present our findings in a clear and understandable manner.

5. **Recommendations:** Based on our analysis, we will provide recommendations or insights that may help in managing and optimizing overtime spending.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset files acquired from the Louisville Metro Government's open data portal, filtered sheets by year.

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, analysis, and visualization.

<!-- - `reports/`: Contains reports summarizing our findings, insights, and recommendations. -->
